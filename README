R script for searching labkey on GEL and annotating/curating cohorts with the aim of designing datasets for hypothesis testing

It does so by creating an SQL statement to join and merge all possible data- from 100k and GMS:
```
sql_str <- paste0("
    SELECT pa.sample_id AS plate_key, pa.participant_id,
           p.participant_phenotyped_sex AS gender,
           p.yob AS year_of_birth,
           p.genetically_inferred_ancestry_thr AS ancestry
    FROM panels_applied pa
    LEFT JOIN rare_diseases_participant_phenotype rd ON pa.participant_id = rd.participant_id
    LEFT JOIN participant_summary p ON pa.participant_id = p.participant_id
    WHERE pa.sample_id IN (", sample_str, ");
  ")
  
  result <- labkey.executeSql(
    baseUrl = "...",
    folderPath = "...",
    schemaName = "lists",
    sql = sql_str
  )
```

Options include


```
("-d", "--disease") "Disease term by which to define a row as case or control by (e.g., 'hypertension')- see readme for how to specify"
("-l", "--list") "file with list of patients (in the first column) that need to be annotated- output annotations will be merged to this file (including other columns)- if none is supplied all patients in 'panels_applied' will be annotated"
("-m", "--merge_by") "If the supplied --list input file needs to be searched according to a column other than the first one- please input that column name here"
("-o", "--output") "output file into which the data will be put- default is 'out.tsv'"
("-c", "--control_age_cutoff") "Year of birth at which to remove controls- defined according to '--disease'"
("-p", "--get_paths") "option to get paths to cram files and genome versions- default = TRUE"
("-n", "--number") "option to take first n rows in from '--list' option"
("-a", "--annotate") "option to annotate rows with disease according to 'panels applied, phenotype and hpo terms'"
("-e", "--cancer_genomes") "include cancer genomes as controls"
("-k", "--order_by") "order the input and output file according to a particular column- specify column name"
("-s", "--suffix")" remove suffix of column on which search is being performed"
("-r", "--prefix") "remove prefix of column on which search is being performed", metavar = "character")
```



Examples of use include:

Rscript curate_dataset.R -l input.tsv -merge_by participant_id
